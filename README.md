# **Microservable - Cloud Microservices Deployment Platform**

## **Overview**

Our platform is a cutting-edge tool designed to simplify the deployment, customization, and orchestration of microservices in the cloud. It provides developers with an intuitive **node-graph-based editor** that allows them to visually design complex microservice architectures, write custom services, and integrate them with pre-built service templates. With seamless deployment to cloud infrastructure and an easy-to-use interface, the platform is perfect for hackathons, programming contests, and rapid application development.

## **Vision**

Our goal is to empower developers by providing them a flexible and scalable environment to build, test, and deploy microservice-based architectures with minimal effort. The platform aims to bridge the gap between **cloud infrastructure**, **microservice development**, and **deployment automation**. By offering developers an intuitive, visual interface combined with powerful cloud-native features, we aim to enable rapid prototyping and innovation, especially in high-pressure environments like hackathons.

## **Features**

### **1. Node-Graph-Based Visual Editor**

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Build and modify your microservice architecture using a simple, visual drag-and-drop interface. Each service is represented as a node in the graph, and you can connect them to define the communication flow between services.
- **Customizable Nodes**: Modify pre-built service templates or create your own custom microservices from Git repositories or Docker containers.
- **Interactive Data Flow**: Easily manage and visualize how data moves between services and define the interactions through configurable endpoints.

### **2. Custom Service Development**

- **Git Repositories**: Write custom microservices and store them in Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). The platform integrates with these repositories to build and deploy services automatically.
- **Docker Containers**: Package your custom services as Docker containers, ensuring portability, scalability, and consistency across environments.
- **OpenAI Service Spec**: Define the **API endpoints**, **request/response formats**, and **authentication** methods for each service using an **OpenAI spec**. This standardized specification ensures smooth communication between services.

### **3. Microservice Templates Library**

- **Pre-Built Templates**: The platform provides a set of pre-built, ready-to-deploy microservice templates (e.g., user authentication, messaging queues, databases) that developers can quickly add to their stack.
- **Integrate with Custom Services**: These templates are easily customizable and can be integrated with your custom services, allowing rapid development of complex systems.

### **4. Real-Time Collaboration**

- **Collaborative Environment**: Teams can collaborate on a single project in real-time, with changes reflected instantly for all members.
- **Version Control**: Automatically track changes to your architecture, microservices, and configurations, making it easy to revert or update at any time.

### **5. Deployment Automation**

- **Auto-Deployment to Cloud Providers**: Once your microservices are designed, the platform automatically generates the necessary infrastructure code (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests) and deploys your stack to popular cloud providers like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Azure**, or **IBM Cloud**.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Built-in continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines that automatically deploy your services as you update them.

### **6. Monitoring & Debugging**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: The platform provides dashboards to track the health and performance of deployed services, including response times, error rates, and system load.
- **Error Tracking & Logs**: Access detailed logs, error reports, and trace data to quickly diagnose and fix issues.
- **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing**: The platform automatically scales your services based on traffic and ensures high availability using cloud-native load balancing techniques.

### **7. Cloud Provider Integration**

- **Multiple Cloud Providers**: Easily deploy your microservices to a variety of cloud platforms. The platform integrates with leading providers, including **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, **Azure**, and **IBM Cloud**, allowing you to choose the best infrastructure for your needs.
- **Free/Low-Cost Tiers**: For hackathons and educational use, the platform supports free or low-cost tiers provided by cloud providers, such as AWS Educate, GCP for Students, and Azure for Students.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Create an Account**

Sign up to start using the platform. Upon registration, you will receive free cloud credits (if available) for cloud service deployment.

### **2. Start a New Project**

Once logged in, create a new project and define your microservice stack using the node-graph editor. Drag and drop pre-built services, customize them, or link your own Git repositories or Docker containers.

### **3. Define Your Custom Services**

For custom microservices:
- **Git Repositories**: Link a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository with your service code.
- **Docker Containers**: Specify a Docker image, and the platform will deploy it to your selected cloud provider.

### **4. Define API Endpoints (OpenAI Spec)**

Use the OpenAI spec editor to define the API endpoints, expected inputs/outputs, authentication methods, and other service metadata. This ensures that your services communicate seamlessly.

### **5. Deploy to the Cloud**

Once your microservice architecture is complete, click **Deploy**. The platform will automatically provision cloud resources, generate the necessary configuration files, and deploy your services.

### **6. Monitor & Iterate**

After deployment, monitor your services in real-time. Make changes to the node graph, add more services, or modify existing ones and redeploy with just a click.

## **Use Cases**

- **Hackathons**: Rapidly prototype complex microservices-based applications. Collaborate in real-time with teammates and deploy your solutions to the cloud with minimal effort.
- **Programming Contests**: Quickly assemble microservice stacks, customize them, and integrate third-party APIs to meet contest requirements.
- **Startups & MVPs**: Build scalable, cloud-native applications by composing pre-built and custom services to rapidly launch your product.

## **Technologies**

- **Frontend**: React, React Flow (for node graph editor), Redux
- **Backend**: Node.js / Python, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, IBM Cloud
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, CircleCI
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
